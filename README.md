degree-fit
==========

This takes in a degree distribution list, and then, calculates parameters using
maximum-likelihood estimation for the following probability distributions:

* truncated scale-free
* poisson
* geometric
* scale-free

Then, it runs a series of goodness of fit tests for each distribution:

* AIC 
* anderson-darling
* kolmogrov-smirnoff
